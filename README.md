# Random TV Episode Generator

This Chrome extension allows you to randomly select and play TV show episodes from a list of available shows and seasons. It also includes an autoplay feature that automatically switches to a new random episode when the current one finishes.

NOTE: As you will see, this project was created by manually adding each episode link to a list on a .json file, as I was struggling to find a way to find the correct attributes to each season and episode listing. If you know a better way, please reach out. Thank you!

## Features

* **Random Episode Selection:** Choose a TV show and optionally select specific seasons to generate a random episode.
* **Autoplay:** Automatically switch to a new random episode when the current episode is about to end on Hulu.
* **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple and intuitive popup interface for easy episode selection.
* **Show and Season Management:** Easily manage and update the list of available shows and seasons in the `episodeLists.json` file.
